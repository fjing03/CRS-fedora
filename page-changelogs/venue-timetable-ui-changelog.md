# Changelog — Venue Timetable UI

## [2026-08-31] Sync upstream/fjing UI refactor (merge fd8c403)

Merged `upstream/fjing` (267 commits `cfc1bb1..f44cc5c`) into `fedora-backend`; brings the full upstream SDD implementation (4becd3f) of this page to this PC. **New page on fedora-backend** — route `/venue-timetable-ui` smoke-tested 200. Playwright e2e spec arrived too; `@playwright/test` added as devDependency — browsers not yet installed on this PC (`npx playwright install` pending, deferred to Phase 2 wiring).

### Files Changed
- `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php` — **theirs**
- `tests/venue-timetable.spec.ts` — **theirs** (575-line Playwright spec)
- Shared: `theme.css`, `ui-common.js`, `mock-data.js`, `layouts/ui-template`, `partials/ui-nav-bar` — **theirs**

## [2026-08-15] Detail modal: status description as its own row

Added a **Status Description** row ("Replacement request awaiting approval" / "Class booked for this venue") separate from the Status badge.

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `openModal()` | Updated | Split `Status` and `Status Description` rows. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Detail modal refinements: gray × close, split rows, status badge

### Summary

- **Close button** — normal gray `×`; removed header `modal-status-badge`.
- **Split rows** — Subject Code/Name, Start/End Time split; status as badge row with brief description.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Modal shell | Updated | Removed header `modal-status-badge`. |
| `openModal()` | Updated | Split rows, badge status + description. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Detail modal redesign + fix (was never opening)

### Summary

- **Fix**: the Booked-Class detail modal opened with `.classList.add('open')` but only `.modal-overlay.show` is styled — the modal never displayed. Now uses `DetailModal` (`.show`).
- **Redesign**: converts the static `modal-field` rows to the shared `DetailModal` "Detail Sheet" (identity header, single flat group, definition rows without per-row borders). Same data (Course/Name/Lecturer/Venue/Cohort/Time/Status/Remarks).

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Modal shell | Updated | Body emptied (JS-generated now). |
| `openModal()` | Rewritten | Uses `DetailModal.render`; fixed `.open` → `.show`. |
| `closeModal()` | Updated | Uses `DetailModal.close()`. |

## [2026-08-15] Page-specific summary card descriptions

### Summary

Added page-specific `description` text to each summary card (Total Slots / Available / Pending / Unavailable) instead of relying on the shared generic descriptions in `ui-summary-bar`.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Summary bar cards | Updated | Each card now passes a page-specific `description` (e.g. Unavailable = "booked class, Sunday, or public holiday"). |

---

## [2026-08-15] Summary: Sunday + Public Holiday folded into "Unavailable"

### Summary

The venue summary previously had an "Occupied" card while Sunday (`.cell-sun`) and Public Holiday (`.cell-ph`) cells were not counted at all — so `Total` did not cover the whole grid and the labels were misleading. `Occupied` + `Sunday` + `Public Holiday` are all "cannot book this slot", so they're now grouped under a single **Unavailable** card.

New cards: **Total Slots**, **Available**, **Pending**, **Unavailable** (= Occupied + Sunday + Public Holiday). `Total = Available + Pending + Unavailable` now exactly equals the grid cells. Legend updated to Available / Pending / Unavailable with a tooltip explaining the grouped reasons.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Summary bar cards | Updated | Replaced "Occupied" card with "Unavailable"; `valueId` `sumOccupied` → `sumUnavailable`. |
| Legend bar items | Updated | "Occupied" → "Unavailable" with tip `Cannot book — slot is booked, Sunday, or public holiday`. |
| `updateSummaries()` | Updated | `unavailable = occupied + sunday + ph`; `total = available + pending + unavailable`. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Summary stats now match the rendered grid (accurate counts)

### Summary

The summary cards were inaccurate in two ways:
1. **Occupied/Pending** counted event objects, not hour slots — a 3-hour booking showed as "1" instead of the 3 cells it occupies on the grid.
2. **Available** only counted Monday–Friday (`di < 5`), while the grid also renders Saturday as a working day, so `Total`/`Available` under-counted.

Now `updateSummaries()` counts exactly the cells the grid renders (`.cell-occupied`, `.cell-pending`, `.cell-available`), so the cards always match the timetable — including overlapping bookings from multiple cohorts that share an hour slot. Falls back to 0 when no venue is selected.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `updateSummaries()` | Rewritten | Counts rendered `.cell-content` cells (`occupied`/`pending`/`available`) directly from the `.timetable` DOM instead of re-deriving from `events`; this handles overlapping bookings and all working days (incl. Saturday). |

---

## [2026-08-13] Legend bar background fix

### Summary

Legend bar now has `background: var(--color-surface)` so swatches render on the same surface as timetable cells, ensuring color consistency.

### Files Changed

#### `public/css/theme.css`

| Timestamp | Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-13 | `.legend-bar` | Updated | Added `padding`, `background: var(--color-surface)`, `border`, `border-radius` |

---

## [2026-08-13] OOP Refactor: Align cell-available with shared theme.css

### Summary

Removed duplicate `.cell-available` + hover CSS (now in `theme.css`). Simplified `.cell-content.cell-occupied` to remove redundant positioning (inherited from `.cell-content` in theme.css). Updated JS to wrap available cells in `.cell-content` class for consistency with replacement-arrangement.

| 2026-08-13 | Line 1208 | Changed | `div.className = 'cell-available'` → `'cell-content cell-available'` |

Added `:focus-visible` rings to `fav-btn`, `segment-toggle button`, `venue-type-btn`, `print-btn`, `btn-book`, `error-banner button`, `no-match-banner button`. |
| 2026-08-13 | `public/css/theme.css` (shared) | macOS table fix | `.timetable`: `border-collapse:collapse` → `separate` + `border-spacing:4px`; removed 1px cell borders; hover uses `var(--color-surface-variant)`; removed zebra striping. `.badge` border-radius 6px→8px. |
| 2026-08-13 | `public/css/theme.css` (shared) | CSS tooltip + legend refactor | Added `[data-tip]` CSS tooltip system (above element, inverse-surface bg, arrow, opacity transition). Legend bar: `flex-direction: column`, hint moved to top-left above swatches. Legend swatches use container tokens matching cell backgrounds. Legend bar has `background: var(--color-surface)` for consistent rendering. |
| 2026-08-14 | `buildTimetable()` | OOP refactor | Hand-built `<table>` replaced with shared `buildTimetableGrid({cellRender})` from ui-common.js. cellRender handles holiday/Sunday (cell-ph/cell-sun), event/occupied (cell-pending/cell-occupied), available cells + booking tooltip + mobile available cards. |
| 2026-08-14 | `prevWeek/nextWeek/selectWeek`, today btn | WeekNavigator delegation | Local nav logic replaced with `weekNav.prevWeek()/nextWeek()/selectWeek()` + `currentWeek` re-sync. Today button now uses `weekNav.initTodayBtn()` (class jumpToToday) + persist listener. |

## [2026-10-03] Disabled print icon on the week-nav toolbar

Shared `ui-week-nav` gained an opt-in `'showPrint' => true` arg rendering a printer icon-button
(inline SVG, `.print-btn` in theme.css), right-aligned at the toolbar edge via `margin-left: auto`.
Enabled stub: click fires the shared `toast.show('Printing is coming soon')` bottom-left toast bar;
`title="Coming soon"` native tooltip on hover. No JS beyond the one-liner onclick.

Venue Timetable renders its own identical hand-placed button (`.print-btn`, inline
`margin-left:auto`, same toast onclick) instead of the partial arg — the page's `showPrint` stays
off so exactly one button renders per page.

Venue Timetable renders its own identical hand-placed button (`.print-btn`, inline
`margin-left:auto`) instead of the partial arg — the page's `showPrint` stays off so exactly one
button renders per page.

## [2026-10-03] Book offered only when the slot can fit a booking

The venue page advertised "Book" on cells too late in the day for the arrangement page's
4-slot booking span (e.g. 18:00) — users landed straight into the conflict state. Cells where
start + BOOK_SPAN (= 4 half-hour slots, matching the arrangement's default MAX_SELECTION) would
run past day end now carry .cell-no-fit: hover label "Not bookable" + not-allowed cursor, and
clicking shows an explanatory toast ("A booking needs 120 minutes — not enough time left in the
day.") instead of the Book tooltip. Fitting cells behave exactly as before. Also: the page's
week position moved to its own localStorage key ('venueTimetableWeek'), so browsing the
replacement-arrangement grid no longer jumps this page's week. 0 console errors.

### Follow-up: a fresh Book click resets that booking's sticky memories

If a slot's auto-select was previously discarded (bookingIntentCancelled) or its reminder
dismissed (bookingIntentDismissed), re-booking the SAME slot from the venue page now clears
those keys before navigating — a fresh Book click is a fresh intent, so the banner shows and
the auto-select fires again. Other bookings' memories are untouched.

## [2026-10-03] Round-2 fixes: Class Details on desktop + tooltip staleness + keyboard

1. **Class Details modal was unreachable on desktop**: occupied/pending cells had no click
   listener (openModal was wired only to the mobile cards). Desktop cells now open the modal
   (cursor pointer, focusable, aria-label), keyboard focus tracked.
2. **Book tooltip went stale across week/venue switches**: the tooltip survived grid rebuilds
   still offering the old date/venue. buildTimetable now dismisses it on every rebuild.
3. **Keyboard B shortcut needed arrow-key navigation first**: clicking or focusing a cell now
   sets the tracked cell, so B works after click/Tab too.

Verified: occupied/pending modals on desktop, tooltip dismissal on week + venue change,
B-after-click, plus the venue-side regression set — 0 console errors.

## [2026-10-03] Round-3 fixes: mobile card list finally visible + keyboard reaches booked cells

1. **Mobile card list was built but never shown**: buildTimetable hid #mobileCardList and nothing
   re-showed it — 100+ cards (booked classes AND bookable slots) were dead markup at phone widths
   while the 7×22 desktop grid squeezed into 356px with no scroll. The list now reveals after
   every rebuild when cards exist (media-query aware), #timetable hides on ≤768px via
   body[data-page] scoped CSS, and a resize listener keeps both honest without a rebuild.
2. **Keyboard dead-end on booked cells**: occupied/pending cells are focusable (round 2) but
   arrows/Enter did nothing on them. Arrow navigation now walks ALL focusable cells; Enter on a
   booked cell opens its Class Details modal (Enter on available cells still opens the Book
   tooltip; B stays available-only).

Verified: card list on mobile (B103 booked cards + B002 bookable cards), week change re-render,
desktop unaffected, Enter/arrow/B keyboard paths, resize both directions — 0 console errors.

## [2026-10-04] Round-4 fixes: stale keyboard cell + venue guard

1. **B shortcut used a detached cell**: focusedCell survived grid rebuilds — B after a week/venue
   switch opened the Book tooltip from the old cell. buildTimetable now clears it (mirroring the
   tooltip dismissal).
2. **Unknown venue codes could clobber the selection**: onVenueChange assigned
   `currentVenue = MockData.venues.find(...)` BEFORE its guard — a stale favourite code left
   currentVenue undefined (trigger stale, page half-broken). VenueDropdown.select() now validates
   against the master list (ignores unknown codes), and onVenueChange resolves into a temp before
   committing. (Not user-reachable in the mock — the panel only lists real venues — hardening.)
3. Shared: week-filter keyboard fallback ([ / ]) no longer crashes on pages without #weekFilter.

Verified star sync across venue switches, favourites cap tooltip, B-after-rebuild, and the
regression set — 0 console errors.

## [2026-10-04] Lead-time rule: venue booking blocked < 3 working days out

Same rule as the arrangement page (shared `isSlotTooSoon`, MOCK_NOW anchor — see that page's
changelog entry): otherwise-free cells inside the 3-working-day window (and past days) render
read-only (`cell-too-soon`, hover "Min. 3 working days ahead") — **no Book tooltip, no
keyboard, no mobile bookable card**. Booked/pending classes still render normally, including in
past weeks (read-only browsing of history stays intact).

The summary bar counts too-soon cells as Unavailable (Unavailable = booked + Sunday + holiday +
too soon) so Total stays consistent; the legend tooltip documents the new reason.

Verified: Week 11 Mon/Tue blocked + Wed–Sat bookable, booked classes visible inside blocked
days, past weeks read-only with classes shown, summary arithmetic, no tooltip on too-soon
cells, mobile card list reduced to informational cards — 0 console errors.

**Follow-up:** the lead-time rule is announced in the UI — a notice under the venue header
("Bookable from Wednesday, 07 Oct 2026 onward — replacement requests need at least 3 working
days' notice."), date computed from MOCK_NOW + holidays via the shared
`leadTimeCutoff()`/`renderLeadTimeNote()` helpers.

**Rework:** the lead-time notice moved above the grid and became a contextual banner (booking-
banner family, neutral info tone) — shown while the viewed week has blocked days, hidden on
fully open weeks, copy adapts (passed week / current week / partially blocked).

**Tweak:** the lead-time banner's date ("Wednesday, 07 Oct 2026") uses the success/green
token so the opening date reads as the focal point.

**Fix ("Today" consistency):** the venue template's local `getTodayMs()` shadow (pre-refactor
leftover) was deleted — it silently overrode the shared mock-anchored helper, making this page
read the REAL clock while the arrangement read `MockData.mockNow`. Both pages now use the one
shared anchor.

**Note (no visible change):** the shared `ui-today-btn` partial and `WeekNavigator` gained an
"earliest bookable" variant used by the replacement-arrangement page (where unbookable weeks
are hidden and "Today" would point off the visible range). The venue page keeps its full week
list and "Today" — it's the browsing/history page, so no change applies here.

**Note (no visible change):** the "Book from" grid chip is opt-in (cfg.bookableBadge) — only
the replacement-arrangement page renders it; this page keeps its full week list + "Today"
button (id todayBtn, unchanged).

**Note (no visible change):** the BOOKINGS OPEN badge (success-green) remains opt-in on the
replacement-arrangement page; this page keeps its today-badge (primary) and full week list.

**Note (shared anchor move):** `MockData.mockNow` → Mon 5 Oct 2026 — the venue's current week
is now Week 10 (05 Oct ~ 11 Oct) with the TODAY badge on the Mon column; the lead-time
blackout boundary becomes Thu 08 Oct on both pages.

**Tweak (label parity):** the venue's week select drops its custom labelFn and uses the shared
default — "Week 10 · 28 Sep 2026 ~ 04 Oct 2026" (· separator, both years) — now identical in
format to the arrangement's selector. Nothing else changes.

**Tweak (summary cards commented out):** the four summary cards (Total Slots / Available /
Pending / Unavailable) are Blade-commented on this page — the grid already shows the same
state colour-coded and the legend explains it, so the counts added little value to the booking
journey. The shared `ui-summary-bar` partial is untouched (8 other pages use it); the include
is restored by uncommenting, and `updateSummaries()` is null-guarded + keeps its counting so
the page runs without the cards.

**Tweak (dropdown arrow consistency):** the venue dropdown trigger now uses the SAME design as
the week-select family — the label and the chevron are split (label span + shared 10×6
stroke-1.5 chevron SVG, currentColor/token-toned), so the filled "▾" text glyph is gone;
typography aligned to the week select (13px/600, height 36px, radius-md — was 14px/500,
radius-sm). The old stale-green arrow hex (#3d5a48, an orphan of a previous palette) is
replaced across ALL selects by per-theme strokes mirroring the tokens
(dark/on-surface-variant #9EAAB8, light #5A6978; semester-bar selects mirror
on-primary-container #6BA3E0 / #003366) since SVG data-URIs cannot use var().

### Postscript — sweep-fixes-round-1 (2026-10-06, F-4)

**Status badges no longer leak raw lowercase enums.** New shared `StatusText.label()`
promoted to ui-common (3 sites on this page = the duplication threshold): history card
(:660), event card (:846), modal Status row (:914) now print
"Normal" / "Replacement" / "Pending" (Title case §10.0 vocabulary) while the
`badge-*` CSS keys stay raw-enum — zero visual/color change, text only.

### Postscript — sweep-fixes-round-2 (2026-10-06, F-6 + token fix)

1. **F-6 — mobile slot list grouped by day**: the builder emits an italic `.m-slot-day`
   header ("Thu · 08 Oct 2026") before each day's run of cards (event cards AND bookable
   cards), so the 60+ button wall becomes day-sectioned. Headers re-emit with every
   builder pass (verified Week 11 → 5 headers, Week 12 → 6 fresh, no duplicates/stale),
   card flow unchanged (click → Book tooltip → arrangement).
2. **Token fix (static scan T9):** `color: #fff` ×2 (booking banner, `.venue-available-card`)
   → `var(--color-on-primary)` — the live pass on this page in the sweep skipped the token
   scan; the static grep across all 9 templates caught them. Zero visual change (on-primary
   = white on primary in both themes).
