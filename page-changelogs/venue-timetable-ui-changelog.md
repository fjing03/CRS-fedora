# Changelog — Venue Timetable UI

## [2026-08-31] Sync upstream/fjing UI refactor (merge fd8c403)

Merged `upstream/fjing` (267 commits `cfc1bb1..f44cc5c`) into `fedora-backend`; brings the full upstream SDD implementation (4becd3f) of this page to this PC. **New page on fedora-backend** — route `/venue-timetable-ui` smoke-tested 200. Playwright e2e spec arrived too; `@playwright/test` added as devDependency — browsers not yet installed on this PC (`npx playwright install` pending, deferred to Phase 2 wiring).

### Files Changed
- `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php` — **theirs**
- `tests/venue-timetable.spec.ts` — **theirs** (575-line Playwright spec)
- Shared: `theme.css`, `ui-common.js`, `mock-data.js`, `layouts/ui-template`, `partials/ui-nav-bar` — **theirs**

## [2026-08-15] Detail modal: status description as its own row

Added a **Status Description** row ("Replacement request awaiting approval" / "Class booked for this venue") separate from the Status badge.

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `openModal()` | Updated | Split `Status` and `Status Description` rows. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Detail modal refinements: gray × close, split rows, status badge

### Summary

- **Close button** — normal gray `×`; removed header `modal-status-badge`.
- **Split rows** — Subject Code/Name, Start/End Time split; status as badge row with brief description.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Modal shell | Updated | Removed header `modal-status-badge`. |
| `openModal()` | Updated | Split rows, badge status + description. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Detail modal redesign + fix (was never opening)

### Summary

- **Fix**: the Booked-Class detail modal opened with `.classList.add('open')` but only `.modal-overlay.show` is styled — the modal never displayed. Now uses `DetailModal` (`.show`).
- **Redesign**: converts the static `modal-field` rows to the shared `DetailModal` "Detail Sheet" (identity header, single flat group, definition rows without per-row borders). Same data (Course/Name/Lecturer/Venue/Cohort/Time/Status/Remarks).

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Modal shell | Updated | Body emptied (JS-generated now). |
| `openModal()` | Rewritten | Uses `DetailModal.render`; fixed `.open` → `.show`. |
| `closeModal()` | Updated | Uses `DetailModal.close()`. |

## [2026-08-15] Page-specific summary card descriptions

### Summary

Added page-specific `description` text to each summary card (Total Slots / Available / Pending / Unavailable) instead of relying on the shared generic descriptions in `ui-summary-bar`.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Summary bar cards | Updated | Each card now passes a page-specific `description` (e.g. Unavailable = "booked class, Sunday, or public holiday"). |

---

## [2026-08-15] Summary: Sunday + Public Holiday folded into "Unavailable"

### Summary

The venue summary previously had an "Occupied" card while Sunday (`.cell-sun`) and Public Holiday (`.cell-ph`) cells were not counted at all — so `Total` did not cover the whole grid and the labels were misleading. `Occupied` + `Sunday` + `Public Holiday` are all "cannot book this slot", so they're now grouped under a single **Unavailable** card.

New cards: **Total Slots**, **Available**, **Pending**, **Unavailable** (= Occupied + Sunday + Public Holiday). `Total = Available + Pending + Unavailable` now exactly equals the grid cells. Legend updated to Available / Pending / Unavailable with a tooltip explaining the grouped reasons.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Summary bar cards | Updated | Replaced "Occupied" card with "Unavailable"; `valueId` `sumOccupied` → `sumUnavailable`. |
| Legend bar items | Updated | "Occupied" → "Unavailable" with tip `Cannot book — slot is booked, Sunday, or public holiday`. |
| `updateSummaries()` | Updated | `unavailable = occupied + sunday + ph`; `total = available + pending + unavailable`. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Summary stats now match the rendered grid (accurate counts)

### Summary

The summary cards were inaccurate in two ways:
1. **Occupied/Pending** counted event objects, not hour slots — a 3-hour booking showed as "1" instead of the 3 cells it occupies on the grid.
2. **Available** only counted Monday–Friday (`di < 5`), while the grid also renders Saturday as a working day, so `Total`/`Available` under-counted.

Now `updateSummaries()` counts exactly the cells the grid renders (`.cell-occupied`, `.cell-pending`, `.cell-available`), so the cards always match the timetable — including overlapping bookings from multiple cohorts that share an hour slot. Falls back to 0 when no venue is selected.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `updateSummaries()` | Rewritten | Counts rendered `.cell-content` cells (`occupied`/`pending`/`available`) directly from the `.timetable` DOM instead of re-deriving from `events`; this handles overlapping bookings and all working days (incl. Saturday). |

---

## [2026-08-13] Legend bar background fix

### Summary

Legend bar now has `background: var(--color-surface)` so swatches render on the same surface as timetable cells, ensuring color consistency.

### Files Changed

#### `public/css/theme.css`

| Timestamp | Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-13 | `.legend-bar` | Updated | Added `padding`, `background: var(--color-surface)`, `border`, `border-radius` |

---

## [2026-08-13] OOP Refactor: Align cell-available with shared theme.css

### Summary

Removed duplicate `.cell-available` + hover CSS (now in `theme.css`). Simplified `.cell-content.cell-occupied` to remove redundant positioning (inherited from `.cell-content` in theme.css). Updated JS to wrap available cells in `.cell-content` class for consistency with replacement-arrangement.

### Files Changed

| 2026-08-13 | Line 1208 | Changed | `div.className = 'cell-available'` → `'cell-content cell-available'` |
