# Changelog — Venue Timetable UI

## [2026-10-09] B005 diploma-cohort conflict — derived flag, owner-gated (SDD b005-diploma-conflict)

First enforcement of `VENUE-RESTRICTIONS.md`: the audit's single violation (AMIT2034 P, Wed 11:00–13:00, B005, combined DFT+DSF diploma lecture) now renders as a **schedule conflict needing replacement**. Derived at render time — no DB mutation, the 3-state slot machine (FR 4.11) is untouched.

- **Conflict derivation** (`venueRestrictionConflict()`): venue `B005` AND any cohort's programme starts with `D` → event `status: 'conflict'` on every page.
- **Owner-gated rendering**: the owner's block is loud striped red (`event-conflict` — "needs YOUR action"); other viewers see quiet red (`event-public-holiday`), matching the legend's Your/Others Conflict split. The shared modal shows "Scheduling conflict — needs attention". No replace button — the write path is Slice B.
- Venue eager-load gained `classSession.venue` (N+1 avoidance); conflict outranks slot-pending/normal per the twin-merge severity map.
- Verified: phpunit 129/129 (845 assertions; +6 conflict tests) · phpstan 0 · lint clean · venue-db 4/4 (live Daniel-5652 owner view) · timetable-wiring 5/5 · nav-identity 3/3.

## [2026-10-09] Post-merge design parity: 7-item legend + ownership cards (SDD merge-upstream-ui-2026-10)

After merging `upstream/fjing` (`e7f8036`, 21 commits — the 2026-10-09 UI batch), the DB-backed Livewire page (`App\Livewire\VenueTimetable`) was adapted to the post-merge venue design. READ-only v1 unchanged: no Book button, no cancel modal (write path = Slice B).

### Page changes
- **Legend 4 → 7 items** (upstream parity): Available / Your Classes / Others' Classes / Others' Pending / Your Pending / Your Conflict (`event-conflict` swatch) / Others' Conflict. Swatch colours match the real grid cells (`.vt-cell-*`); Available tip stays honest ("Free slot…", no "click to book").
- **Summary cards**: Pending card (always 0 in v1 data) replaced by **My Teaching Classes** (`#sumMyClasses` — viewer's session rows, each class counts separately) and **My Teaching Hours** (`#sumMyHours` — viewer's occupied slots × 0.5 h, trailing `.0` stripped). Total / Available / Occupied kept.
- **Twin-merge (defensive)**: same venue+day+start events collapse into one block by severity (conflict > pending > replacement > normal), cohorts joined, students summed — impossible in v1 data (partial unique index); unit-tested via reflection.
- **`statusClassFn` gains the `conflict → event-conflict` contract** (unreachable in v1 — no fake data).

### Verification
- phpunit 123/123 (829 assertions; +ownership-cards and twin-merge tests) · phpstan 0 · lint clean · venue-db 3/3 (live `4288` ownership check: B006 W1 → 8 classes / 14 h) · timetable-wiring 5/5 · nav-identity 3/3.
- Upstream auth-free mock specs are N/A on fedora's auth-first real-data routes (see SDD review-log erratum).

## [2026-08-31] Sync upstream/fjing UI refactor (merge fd8c403)

Merged `upstream/fjing` (267 commits `cfc1bb1..f44cc5c`) into `fedora-backend`; brings the full upstream SDD implementation (4becd3f) of this page to this PC. **New page on fedora-backend** — route `/venue-timetable-ui` smoke-tested 200. Playwright e2e spec arrived too; `@playwright/test` added as devDependency — browsers not yet installed on this PC (`npx playwright install` pending, deferred to Phase 2 wiring).

### Files Changed
- `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php` — **theirs**
- `tests/venue-timetable.spec.ts` — **theirs** (575-line Playwright spec)
- Shared: `theme.css`, `ui-common.js`, `mock-data.js`, `layouts/ui-template`, `partials/ui-nav-bar` — **theirs**

## [2026-08-15] Detail modal: status description as its own row

Added a **Status Description** row ("Replacement request awaiting approval" / "Class booked for this venue") separate from the Status badge.

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `openModal()` | Updated | Split `Status` and `Status Description` rows. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Detail modal refinements: gray × close, split rows, status badge

### Summary

- **Close button** — normal gray `×`; removed header `modal-status-badge`.
- **Split rows** — Subject Code/Name, Start/End Time split; status as badge row with brief description.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Modal shell | Updated | Removed header `modal-status-badge`. |
| `openModal()` | Updated | Split rows, badge status + description. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Detail modal redesign + fix (was never opening)

### Summary

- **Fix**: the Booked-Class detail modal opened with `.classList.add('open')` but only `.modal-overlay.show` is styled — the modal never displayed. Now uses `DetailModal` (`.show`).
- **Redesign**: converts the static `modal-field` rows to the shared `DetailModal` "Detail Sheet" (identity header, single flat group, definition rows without per-row borders). Same data (Course/Name/Lecturer/Venue/Cohort/Time/Status/Remarks).

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Modal shell | Updated | Body emptied (JS-generated now). |
| `openModal()` | Rewritten | Uses `DetailModal.render`; fixed `.open` → `.show`. |
| `closeModal()` | Updated | Uses `DetailModal.close()`. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Page-specific summary card descriptions

### Summary

Added page-specific `description` text to each summary card (Total Slots / Available / Pending / Unavailable) instead of relying on the shared generic descriptions in `ui-summary-bar`.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Summary bar cards | Updated | Each card now passes a page-specific `description` (e.g. Unavailable = "booked class, Sunday, or public holiday"). |

---

## [2026-08-15] Summary: Sunday + Public Holiday folded into "Unavailable"

### Summary

The venue summary previously had an "Occupied" card while Sunday (`.cell-sun`) and Public Holiday (`.cell-ph`) cells were not counted at all — so `Total` did not cover the whole grid and the labels were misleading. `Occupied` + `Sunday` + `Public Holiday` are all "cannot book this slot", so they're now grouped under a single **Unavailable** card.

New cards: **Total Slots**, **Available**, **Pending**, **Unavailable** (= Occupied + Sunday + Public Holiday). `Total = Available + Pending + Unavailable` now exactly equals the grid cells. Legend updated to Available / Pending / Unavailable with a tooltip explaining the grouped reasons.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Summary bar cards | Updated | Replaced "Occupied" card with "Unavailable"; `valueId` `sumOccupied` → `sumUnavailable`. |
| Legend bar items | Updated | "Occupied" → "Unavailable" with tip `Cannot book — slot is booked, Sunday, or public holiday`. |
| `updateSummaries()` | Updated | `unavailable = occupied + sunday + ph`; `total = available + pending + unavailable`. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Summary stats now match the rendered grid (accurate counts)

### Summary

The summary cards were inaccurate in two ways:
1. **Occupied/Pending** counted event objects, not hour slots — a 3-hour booking showed as "1" instead of the 3 cells it occupies on the grid.
2. **Available** only counted Monday–Friday (`di < 5`), while the grid also renders Saturday as a working day, so `Total`/`Available` under-counted.

Now `updateSummaries()` counts exactly the cells the grid renders (`.cell-occupied`, `.cell-pending`, `.cell-available`), so the cards always match the timetable — including overlapping bookings from multiple cohorts that share an hour slot. Falls back to 0 when no venue is selected.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `updateSummaries()` | Rewritten | Counts rendered `.cell-content` cells (`occupied`/`pending`/`available`) directly from the `.timetable` DOM instead of re-deriving from `events`; this handles overlapping bookings and all working days (incl. Saturday). |

---

## [2026-08-13] Legend bar background fix

### Summary

Legend bar now has `background: var(--color-surface)` so swatches render on the same surface as timetable cells, ensuring color consistency.

### Files Changed

#### `public/css/theme.css`

| Timestamp | Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-13 | `.legend-bar` | Updated | Added `padding`, `background: var(--color-surface)`, `border`, `border-radius` |

---

## [2026-08-13] OOP Refactor: Align cell-available with shared theme.css

### Summary

Removed duplicate `.cell-available` + hover CSS (now in `theme.css`). Simplified `.cell-content.cell-occupied` to remove redundant positioning (inherited from `.cell-content` in theme.css). Updated JS to wrap available cells in `.cell-content` class for consistency with replacement-arrangement.

| 2026-08-13 | Line 1208 | Changed | `div.className = 'cell-available'` → `'cell-content cell-available'` |

Added `:focus-visible` rings to `fav-btn`, `segment-toggle button`, `venue-type-btn`, `print-btn`, `btn-book`, `error-banner button`, `no-match-banner button`. |
| 2026-08-13 | `public/css/theme.css` (shared) | macOS table fix | `.timetable`: `border-collapse:collapse` → `separate` + `border-spacing:4px`; removed 1px cell borders; hover uses `var(--color-surface-variant)`; removed zebra striping. `.badge` border-radius 6px→8px. |
| 2026-08-13 | `public/css/theme.css` (shared) | CSS tooltip + legend refactor | Added `[data-tip]` CSS tooltip system (above element, inverse-surface bg, arrow, opacity transition). Legend bar: `flex-direction: column`, hint moved to top-left above swatches. Legend swatches use container tokens matching cell backgrounds. Legend bar has `background: var(--color-surface)` for consistent rendering. |
| 2026-08-14 | `buildTimetable()` | OOP refactor | Hand-built `<table>` replaced with shared `buildTimetableGrid({cellRender})` from ui-common.js. cellRender handles holiday/Sunday (cell-ph/cell-sun), event/occupied (cell-pending/cell-occupied), available cells + booking tooltip + mobile available cards. |
| 2026-08-14 | `prevWeek/nextWeek/selectWeek`, today btn | WeekNavigator delegation | Local nav logic replaced with `weekNav.prevWeek()/nextWeek()/selectWeek()` + `currentWeek` re-sync. Today button now uses `weekNav.initTodayBtn()` (class jumpToToday) + persist listener. |

## [2026-10-03] Disabled print icon on the week-nav toolbar

Shared `ui-week-nav` gained an opt-in `'showPrint' => true` arg rendering a printer icon-button
(inline SVG, `.print-btn` in theme.css), right-aligned at the toolbar edge via `margin-left: auto`.
Enabled stub: click fires the shared `toast.show('Printing is coming soon')` bottom-left toast bar;
`title="Coming soon"` native tooltip on hover. No JS beyond the one-liner onclick.

Venue Timetable renders its own identical hand-placed button (`.print-btn`, inline
`margin-left:auto`, same toast onclick) instead of the partial arg — the page's `showPrint` stays
off so exactly one button renders per page.

Venue Timetable renders its own identical hand-placed button (`.print-btn`, inline
`margin-left:auto`) instead of the partial arg — the page's `showPrint` stays off so exactly one
button renders per page.

## [2026-10-03] Book offered only when the slot can fit a booking

The venue page advertised "Book" on cells too late in the day for the arrangement page's
4-slot booking span (e.g. 18:00) — users landed straight into the conflict state. Cells where
start + BOOK_SPAN (= 4 half-hour slots, matching the arrangement's default MAX_SELECTION) would
run past day end now carry .cell-no-fit: hover label "Not bookable" + not-allowed cursor, and
clicking shows an explanatory toast ("A booking needs 120 minutes — not enough time left in the
day.") instead of the Book tooltip. Fitting cells behave exactly as before. Also: the page's
week position moved to its own localStorage key ('venueTimetableWeek'), so browsing the
replacement-arrangement grid no longer jumps this page's week. 0 console errors.

### Follow-up: a fresh Book click resets that booking's sticky memories

If a slot's auto-select was previously discarded (bookingIntentCancelled) or its reminder
dismissed (bookingIntentDismissed), re-booking the SAME slot from the venue page now clears
those keys before navigating — a fresh Book click is a fresh intent, so the banner shows and
the auto-select fires again. Other bookings' memories are untouched.

## [2026-10-03] Round-2 fixes: Class Details on desktop + tooltip staleness + keyboard

1. **Class Details modal was unreachable on desktop**: occupied/pending cells had no click
   listener (openModal was wired only to the mobile cards). Desktop cells now open the modal
   (cursor pointer, focusable, aria-label), keyboard focus tracked.
2. **Book tooltip went stale across week/venue switches**: the tooltip survived grid rebuilds
   still offering the old date/venue. buildTimetable now dismisses it on every rebuild.
3. **Keyboard B shortcut needed arrow-key navigation first**: clicking or focusing a cell now
   sets the tracked cell, so B works after click/Tab too.

Verified: occupied/pending modals on desktop, tooltip dismissal on week + venue change,
B-after-click, plus the venue-side regression set — 0 console errors.

## [2026-10-03] Round-3 fixes: mobile card list finally visible + keyboard reaches booked cells

1. **Mobile card list was built but never shown**: buildTimetable hid #mobileCardList and nothing
   re-showed it — 100+ cards (booked classes AND bookable slots) were dead markup at phone widths
   while the 7×22 desktop grid squeezed into 356px with no scroll. The list now reveals after
   every rebuild when cards exist (media-query aware), #timetable hides on ≤768px via
   body[data-page] scoped CSS, and a resize listener keeps both honest without a rebuild.
2. **Keyboard dead-end on booked cells**: occupied/pending cells are focusable (round 2) but
   arrows/Enter did nothing on them. Arrow navigation now walks ALL focusable cells; Enter on a
   booked cell opens its Class Details modal (Enter on available cells still opens the Book
   tooltip; B stays available-only).

Verified: card list on mobile (B103 booked cards + B002 bookable cards), week change re-render,
desktop unaffected, Enter/arrow/B keyboard paths, resize both directions — 0 console errors.

## [2026-10-04] Round-4 fixes: stale keyboard cell + venue guard

1. **B shortcut used a detached cell**: focusedCell survived grid rebuilds — B after a week/venue
   switch opened the Book tooltip from the old cell. buildTimetable now clears it (mirroring the
   tooltip dismissal).
2. **Unknown venue codes could clobber the selection**: onVenueChange assigned
   `currentVenue = MockData.venues.find(...)` BEFORE its guard — a stale favourite code left
   currentVenue undefined (trigger stale, page half-broken). VenueDropdown.select() now validates
   against the master list (ignores unknown codes), and onVenueChange resolves into a temp before
   committing. (Not user-reachable in the mock — the panel only lists real venues — hardening.)
3. Shared: week-filter keyboard fallback ([ / ]) no longer crashes on pages without #weekFilter.

Verified star sync across venue switches, favourites cap tooltip, B-after-rebuild, and the
regression set — 0 console errors.

## [2026-10-04] Lead-time rule: venue booking blocked < 3 working days out

Same rule as the arrangement page (shared `isSlotTooSoon`, MOCK_NOW anchor — see that page's
changelog entry): otherwise-free cells inside the 3-working-day window (and past days) render
read-only (`cell-too-soon`, hover "Min. 3 working days ahead") — **no Book tooltip, no
keyboard, no mobile bookable card**. Booked/pending classes still render normally, including in
past weeks (read-only browsing of history stays intact).

The summary bar counts too-soon cells as Unavailable (Unavailable = booked + Sunday + holiday +
too soon) so Total stays consistent; the legend tooltip documents the new reason.

Verified: Week 11 Mon/Tue blocked + Wed–Sat bookable, booked classes visible inside blocked
days, past weeks read-only with classes shown, summary arithmetic, no tooltip on too-soon
cells, mobile card list reduced to informational cards — 0 console errors.

**Follow-up:** the lead-time rule is announced in the UI — a notice under the venue header
("Bookable from Wednesday, 07 Oct 2026 onward — replacement requests need at least 3 working
days' notice."), date computed from MOCK_NOW + holidays via the shared
`leadTimeCutoff()`/`renderLeadTimeNote()` helpers.

**Rework:** the lead-time notice moved above the grid and became a contextual banner (booking-
banner family, neutral info tone) — shown while the viewed week has blocked days, hidden on
fully open weeks, copy adapts (passed week / current week / partially blocked).

**Tweak:** the lead-time banner's date ("Wednesday, 07 Oct 2026") uses the success/green
token so the opening date reads as the focal point.

**Fix ("Today" consistency):** the venue template's local `getTodayMs()` shadow (pre-refactor
leftover) was deleted — it silently overrode the shared mock-anchored helper, making this page
read the REAL clock while the arrangement read `MockData.mockNow`. Both pages now use the one
shared anchor.

**Note (no visible change):** the shared `ui-today-btn` partial and `WeekNavigator` gained an
"earliest bookable" variant used by the replacement-arrangement page (where unbookable weeks
are hidden and "Today" would point off the visible range). The venue page keeps its full week
list and "Today" — it's the browsing/history page, so no change applies here.

**Note (no visible change):** the "Book from" grid chip is opt-in (cfg.bookableBadge) — only
the replacement-arrangement page renders it; this page keeps its full week list + "Today"
button (id todayBtn, unchanged).

**Note (no visible change):** the BOOKINGS OPEN badge (success-green) remains opt-in on the
replacement-arrangement page; this page keeps its today-badge (primary) and full week list.

**Note (shared anchor move):** `MockData.mockNow` → Mon 5 Oct 2026 — the venue's current week
is now Week 10 (05 Oct ~ 11 Oct) with the TODAY badge on the Mon column; the lead-time
blackout boundary becomes Thu 08 Oct on both pages.

**Tweak (label parity):** the venue's week select drops its custom labelFn and uses the shared
default — "Week 10 · 28 Sep 2026 ~ 04 Oct 2026" (· separator, both years) — now identical in
format to the arrangement's selector. Nothing else changes.

**Tweak (summary cards commented out):** the four summary cards (Total Slots / Available /
Pending / Unavailable) are Blade-commented on this page — the grid already shows the same
state colour-coded and the legend explains it, so the counts added little value to the booking
journey. The shared `ui-summary-bar` partial is untouched (8 other pages use it); the include
is restored by uncommenting, and `updateSummaries()` is null-guarded + keeps its counting so
the page runs without the cards.

**Tweak (dropdown arrow consistency):** the venue dropdown trigger now uses the SAME design as
the week-select family — the label and the chevron are split (label span + shared 10×6
stroke-1.5 chevron SVG, currentColor/token-toned), so the filled "▾" text glyph is gone;
typography aligned to the week select (13px/600, height 36px, radius-md — was 14px/500,
radius-sm). The old stale-green arrow hex (#3d5a48, an orphan of a previous palette) is
replaced across ALL selects by per-theme strokes mirroring the tokens
(dark/on-surface-variant #9EAAB8, light #5A6978; semester-bar selects mirror
on-primary-container #6BA3E0 / #003366) since SVG data-URIs cannot use var().

### Postscript — sweep-fixes-round-1 (2026-10-06, F-4)

**Status badges no longer leak raw lowercase enums.** New shared `StatusText.label()`
promoted to ui-common (3 sites on this page = the duplication threshold): history card
(:660), event card (:846), modal Status row (:914) now print
"Normal" / "Replacement" / "Pending" (Title case §10.0 vocabulary) while the
`badge-*` CSS keys stay raw-enum — zero visual/color change, text only.

### Postscript — sweep-fixes-round-2 (2026-10-06, F-6 + token fix)

1. **F-6 — mobile slot list grouped by day**: the builder emits an italic `.m-slot-day`
   header ("Thu · 08 Oct 2026") before each day's run of cards (event cards AND bookable
   cards), so the 60+ button wall becomes day-sectioned. Headers re-emit with every
   builder pass (verified Week 11 → 5 headers, Week 12 → 6 fresh, no duplicates/stale),
   card flow unchanged (click → Book tooltip → arrangement).
2. **Token fix (static scan T9):** `color: #fff` ×2 (booking banner, `.venue-available-card`)
   → `var(--color-on-primary)` — the live pass on this page in the sweep skipped the token
   scan; the static grep across all 9 templates caught them. Zero visual change (on-primary
   = white on primary in both themes).

### Postscript — venue-event-blocks (2026-10-07, SDD change `venue-event-blocks`)

**Booked/pending classes now render as cohort-style merged event blocks** (this page was the
last timetable surface still drawing one flat red square per half-hour). Only the
occupied-state branches of this page's `cellRender` changed — booking branches
(available / too-soon / Sunday / holiday) are untouched:

1. **Event blocks** — head half-hour emits `div.event-block span-{N}` (span = half-hours,
   `td.colSpan` when span > 1; continuation half-hours hidden). Mine/others ± pending
   classes via `e.lecturer === MockData.currentUser.name` (same pairing as Cohort);
   `ev-code`/`ev-venue`/`ev-time` content, `.event-block::after` tooltip
   (`name · lecturer`), click/Enter → the existing Booked-Class detail modal. Mobile
   booked-card emission unchanged (runs from the rewritten head branch).
2. **Keyboard parity** — the venue keydown roving now accepts `.event-block[tabindex="0"]`
   alongside `.cell-content[tabindex="0"]`; Enter on a block opens the modal; `B` shortcut
   stays available-cells-only.
3. **Legend 4 items** — Available / Your Classes / Others' Classes / Pending (was 3 items).
   Accepted trade-off (documented in the proposal): Available cells and Others' Classes
   blocks share `--color-success-container`; the legend tips + the reworded booking hint
   disambiguate.
4. **Booking hint copy** — "Click any green **empty** slot to book this venue" (the old line
   became literally false once green event blocks render).
5. **Summary cards restored** (were commented out) — Total Slots / Available / Pending /
   Unavailable, counted span-weighted from the week's deduped event heads
   (`<di>:<start>` last-write-wins = grid slotMap semantics, non-offday guard) so the
   cards always match what the grid renders. Default view (B002, current week):
   154 / 66 / 0 / 88.
6. **Tests** — `tests/venue-timetable.spec.ts`: TC32/TC40 generic subject-code regex;
   TC35 new legend labels; TC36/TC58 4 cards; TC37 new ids; TC41 venue-row locator
   disambiguated (`hasText: /\(\d+ seats\)/` — `:has-text("Venue")` also matched the
   Status Description row); TC39/TC42–44 went live unchanged. Suite: 36 → 45 passing; the
   16 remaining failures are pre-existing macos-ui-refactor staleness (native
   `#venueSelect`, venue-type filter, print button) — out of scope here, tracked for a
   follow-up change.

No shared files touched (`theme.css`, `ui-common.js`, `mock-data.js`, partials). Block
builder duplicated a 2nd time (cohort = 1st) — promote-to-shared deferred to a 3rd
occurrence per house rule.

### Postscript — holiday-badge-generic-label (2026-10-07, shared ui-common)

Day-header holiday badges now read generically as **PUBLIC HOLIDAY** (markup
text `Public Holiday`; the badge CSS already uppercases it), with the specific
holiday name — e.g. `Deepavali Holiday (In Lieu)`, `Christmas Eve` — shown on
hover via the shared `data-tip` tooltip system. Label-less holiday flags show
no tooltip. One-line change in `HtmlBuilder.dayHeader` (ui-common.js:2155);
applies to every timetable page via the shared builder.

## [2026-10-07] Class Details modal grouped into tabs

Venue class-detail modal now splits into 2 tabs: **Session** (code, name,
lecturer, cohort, start/end) / **Venue & Status** (venue, status badge,
description, remarks). Blade: `venue-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`.

### Postscript — cancel-class-enhancement (2026-10-08, SDD change `cancel-class-enhancement`)

Lecturers can now cancel their own classes — status normal with an end time
in the future (real clock) — directly from the venue grid's class modal via
the shared CancelClassModal (`partials/ui-cancel-class-modal`) with a
mandatory enum reason (6 values incl. Other + detail; OOP: `ClassCancellation`
in `ui-common.js`). A cancelled block vanishes and its slot frees; the
sessionStorage ledger (`classCancellationLedger`) replays the state across
pages, with an undo toast (12 s) on any landing page until undone/arranged.

### Postscript — toast snooze (2026-10-08, SDD-waived micro-fix)

✕-closing the cancellation undo toast now snoozes it for the browser session
(per-entry `toastSnoozed` in the ledger; `ToastManager.close()` in
`ui-common.js`, layout ✕ → `toast.close()`). Cancelled state + freed slot
replay unchanged; a new cancellation toasts again.

## [2026-10-08] Conflict blocks render red + twin merge + 6-item legend (bug audit + venue-legend-parity)

Four fixes, applied together because they interlock:

- **Combined-lecture twins were last-win.** Grid `slotMap` overwrote per event,
  so for a same-slot twin pair (e.g. B110 week 3 AMCS2093: DFT2 conflict first,
  DSF2 normal second) the normal twin won and the slot rendered green.
  `getVenueEvents()` now merges duplicates: one block, cohort joined
  ("DFT2(S1) + DSF2(S1)"), status combined by severity
  (conflict > pending > replacement > normal). This also stops the modal showing
  the cohort slug (`dsf2s1`) — the display name is kept.
- **Conflict branch in `cellRender`.** `status === 'conflict'` now gets
  `.event-conflict` (red, owner-agnostic, §10.0 parity with cohort) instead of
  falling into the mine/others greens. Live: B006 week 0 BMIT3084 red;
  B110 week 3 AMCS2093 red.
- **Legend grew 4 → 6 items** per the frozen `venue-legend-parity` design §1:
  Available, Your Classes, Others' Classes, Others' Pending (grey
  `--color-surface-variant`), Your Pending, Conflict / Public Holiday. Spec
  TC34/TC35 updated to the 6-item exact-text assertions.
- **Modal**: Status Description for conflicts now reads "Scheduling conflict —
  needs attention" (was "Class booked for this venue"); a Total Students row was
  added, resolved from the course registry per merged cohort (B110 AMCS2093 →
  50, B006 BMIT3084 → 14) since `cohortTimetable.events` carry no per-event
  count.

Known collision intentionally left: Available and Others' Classes share the
same green (user decision, 2026-10-07; frozen design keeps it).

### Postscript — snooze rule extended (2026-10-08, U3 decision)

The undo toast now shows for **5 s** (was 12 s) and **auto-dismissing after the
full display also snoozes** it — surviving the whole toast counts as "seen",
same as clicking ✕. Only navigating away mid-display (timer killed) leaves the
entry unsnoozed, so the toast legitimately re-shows on the next load.
`ToastManager.show` gained an `onAutoDismiss` hook alongside `onManualDismiss`;
`UNDO_TOAST_MS` 12000 → 5000. Live-verified all three paths, 0 console errors.

### Postscript — undo feedback + grid rebuild (2026-10-08, U1/U2)

Clicking the undo toast's **Undo** now works as it looks: `ToastManager`
dismisses the undo bar **before** running the callback (U1 — the callback's
"Class restored." toast was previously wiped ~0 ms after appearing), and the
callback rebuilds whichever grid is on screen after `ClassCancellation.undo()`
(U2 — every timetable page's `buildTimetable()` / replacement-home's
`buildTable()`; the class reappears without a manual reload). Confirmation
toast shows last, over the rebuilt grid. Live-verified on my-timetable,
student page, and replacement-home; 0 console errors.

### Postscript — resize listener de-duped (2026-10-08, exempted from Batch-7 rejection)

`buildTimetable()` re-registered an anonymous `resize` listener on every
venue/week change, so N rebuilds stacked N copies (each resize ran N redraws
of the mobile-card-list toggle). The handler is now stored on
`window.__venueResizeHandler` and the previous one is removed before the new
one is added — exactly one live listener regardless of rebuild count.
Instrumented live check: 3 adds / 3 removes across rebuilds, mobile card list
still toggles correctly at 375 px / 1440 px; 0 console errors. (The rest of
Batch 7 — column/Sunday/span cosmetics — remains REJECTED.)

### Postscript — venue-legend-parity shipped (2026-10-08)

Legend bar rebuilt to the cohort page's exact five class-status items,
preceded by the venue-only **Available** item (6 total, in order):
Available · Your Classes · Others' Classes · Others' Pending · Your
Pending · Conflict / Public Holiday. Item 6's tip carries the venue
nuance (public-holiday slots show as empty 'PH' cells — not red).

To keep the new legend truthful, the venue `cellRender` gained the
missing conflict branch: `e.status === 'conflict'` now renders
`event-conflict` (red, owner-agnostic — parity with the cohort builder)
before the mine/others fallback. Previously a conflicted class (e.g.
B110 Monday `AMCS2093`, "Lecturer on leave") silently rendered as an
ordinary green block on this page while rendering red everywhere else.

Branch order is unchanged (sunday/holiday cells still win — a booked
class on an offday still shows the offday cell), booking affordances
untouched, `.event-conflict` was already global in theme.css (no new
CSS). Live-verified: 6-item legend desktop + mobile, B110 Week 4
AMCS2093 red / AMIS1012 green, 130 available cells intact. This
supersedes venue-event-blocks' 4-item legend expectations (TC34/TC35
rewritten to 6 items during the spec de-stale). Implementation landed
in `b47221e` (parallel session); artifacts in
`.sdd/changes/venue-legend-parity/`.

### Postscript — My Teaching summary cards, Pending removed (2026-10-08)

**Pending** card removed (held slots still count toward Total Slots);
added **My Teaching Classes** + **My Teaching Hours** — same semantics
and labels as the cohort page, scoped to this venue. Final bar:
Total Slots · Available · My Teaching Classes · My Teaching Hours ·
Unavailable (red card last, mirroring cohort). Counting is
grid-equivalent: offday events excluded (they render as PH cells),
merged-cohort twins deduped. Verified B110 → **1 class / 2 hours**
(AMCS2093(L)). Spec TC36 4→5 cards, TC37 ids, TC58 mobile count,
new TC38b (B110 weekly pattern).

### Postscript — conflict blocks made unmistakable (2026-10-08)

`.event-conflict` (global, theme.css) upgraded from a plain red tint to
a **2px solid `--color-error` border + diagonal caution stripes**
(`repeating-linear-gradient` over the container tint, token-only via
`color-mix` — adapts to dark theme). Same meaning, same red per §10.0;
just impossible to mistake for an ordinary block at grid glance.
Applies to every page rendering conflicted classes (cohort, venue,
my timetable, student). No legend or test changes needed; verified live
on cohort (dft2s1 W4 AMCS2093) and venue (B110 W4), suite 124 passed.

### Postscript — loud conflict red is now owner-gated (2026-10-08)

The loud red treatment (stripes + border, `event-conflict`) is reserved for
**the logged-in lecturer's own** conflicted / public-holiday classes.
Other lecturers' conflicted classes and PH-day classes fall back to a
**quiet red tint** (`event-public-holiday`, no stripes/border) — the class
still reads as "won't run / needs attention (someone else's)", just without
hijacking your attention. Legend split into two entries: **Your
Conflict / Holiday** (swatch reuses the real loud `event-conflict` class so
the legend shows the exact styling) and **Others' Conflict / Holiday**
(plain tint). Slot-status hint text updated to match. My Timetable keeps
its existing behaviour (all events shown are the viewer's own, so
semantics are unchanged); student page intentionally untouched (owner-blind
red there). Verified live: cohort dft1s1 W1 Muada's `MPU-2302(T)` quiet,
dft2s1 W4 own `AMCS2093(L)` loud; venue B110 W4 loud + B101 W1 quiet.
TC34/35 → 7 legend items; new TC35b (owner-gating on venue); TC45–48
tooltip tests now scroll-settle before clicking (auto-scroll race with the
by-design scroll-hide, exposed by the taller 7-item legend); suite green.

### Postscript — diagonal hatching removed; loud red = 3px border only (2026-10-09)

The 45° caution stripes on `.event-conflict` proved too busy — reverted to
a plain `--color-error-container` tint, with the border thickened
2px → **3px** so own/personal conflicted + public-holiday classes still
read unmistakably (owner-gating unchanged: loud border = yours, quiet
plain tint = others' on cohort/venue; personal pages all loud). Legend
swatches follow automatically. Verified live on all four pages.

### Postscript — own public-holiday classes now render on the venue grid (2026-10-09)

Holiday days used to flatten the whole day into empty 'PH' cells. Now the
logged-in lecturer's OWN classes on a public-holiday day still render — as
loud red `event-conflict` blocks (3px border, parity with my-timetable:
"your class won't run"), with full modal interaction. Other lecturers'
holiday classes and Sundays stay empty `cell-ph`/`cell-sun` cells.
Summary cards unchanged (offday events still excluded from My Teaching /
counts — visible-but-not-counted is intentional). Legend 'Your Conflict'
tip updated. Verified: B011 W14 own `AMCS2093(P)` Fri loud (Thu Christmas
Eve cells empty), B110 W8 own `AMCS2093(L)` Mon loud, B006 W8 all-others
day fully suppressed (22 PH cells).

### Postscript — venue dropdown: B006 under Lab + full-name tooltips (2026-10-09)

- **CiscoLab (B006) now groups under the Lab category** in the cascading
  VenueDropdown (Type → Block → Floor → Room) — Type column shows 3
  categories; B006 sits with B005/B009/B010/B011 under Block B → Ground
  Floor. Registry `type: 'CiscoLab'` untouched (dropdown-only
  normalization, `_typeOf()`); the room tooltip still reveals its true
  "Cisco Lab" identity.
- **Every dropdown option now carries a hover tooltip** (shared data-tip
  utility — fixed, shown above the item, viewport-clamped): room options
  show the full name (`B006 · Cisco Lab · Ground Floor, Block B`); parent
  options (Favourites/Recent/type/block/floor rows) show descriptive
  counts (`Lab — 5 venues`, `Block B — 5 venues`, …).
- TC23 → 3 categories; new TC23b (Lab cascade includes B006, tips present,
  hover reveals true name above the item).

### Postscript — hairline block borders + status tooltips (2026-10-09)

- **Venue page only:** regular event blocks get a `0.5px` hairline border
  (`--color-outline-strong`) for definition — scoped via the blade's
  `page-styles` (`#timetable .event-block:not(.event-conflict)`); the
  viewer's own conflict / public-holiday blocks are excluded and keep their
  loud 3px border. (Renders as a 1px hairline at 1× DPR.)
- **Block tooltips now end with the run-status:** the venue cellRender tip
  is `"Subject · Lecturer · Status"` — the status label comes from the new
  shared `eventStatusLabel()` helper in ui-common (Normal / Pending /
  Replacement / Conflict / Cancelled, with a public-holiday day outranking
  the event's own status as "Public Holiday").

### Postscript — §10.0 two-axis block language + legend trim (2026-10-09)

- **Colour = status, border = ownership.** Blocks now share one fill per
  status (Normal = success green, Pending = tertiary, Conflict/Holiday =
  error red); ownership moved entirely to border weight — **3px = your
  classes, 0.5px hairline = others'**. The quiet-vs-loud red split is gone:
  everyone's conflicts are the same error red, only the border differs.
- Replacement keeps its blue **only on the personal pages**; on this page it
  folds into Normal (tooltip still says "Replacement").
- Legend trimmed to status chips only (swatches reuse the real block
  classes), plus an ownership hint — *"thick border = your classes ·
  hairline = others'"* — replacing the Your/Others swatch pairs.

### Postscript — tooltip parity + card keywords (2026-10-09, SDD: warning-modal-keywords)

The print button's native `title=` tooltip moved to the shared `data-tip` bubble system
(same text), and the venue modal's close ✕ now shows a "Close" tooltip like every other
modal. The five summary-card flip-backs carry the new keyword language — one bold-uppercase
keyword per description (`FREE TIME SLOTS`, `YOU TEACH`, …), with the "Cannot book" card's
keyword in red (`CANNOT BOOK`) since it's an attention card.
