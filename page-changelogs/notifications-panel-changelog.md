# Changelog — Notifications Panel (shared nav bell)

## [2026-10-02] Notifications panel behind the nav bell (frontend mock) — SDD change `notifications-panel`

Kills the `alert('Notifications panel')` stub and the hardcoded "3" badge: the
top-bar bell now opens a real panel — an **unread-only todo tray** with per-role
rows and localStorage read-state (FR-4.15 / 2.13 / 1.9 mock surface; FR 4.16
backend = Sprint 3).

### Files Created

#### `resources/views/partials/ui-notifications-panel.blade.php`
- Overlay + dialog shell: scrim, `role="dialog"` panel, header with unread pill
  and **"Mark all as read"** text button (user-granted rule-5 exception; hidden
  at 0 unread), ✕ close, JS-rendered `#notifList` body.
- Inline caught-up empty state ("You're all caught up").
- Wired by the ui-common `initNotifPanel` module — no page-side JS.

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `resources/views/partials/ui-nav-bar.blade.php` | Bell → `toggleNotifPanel()` + `aria-haspopup` / `data-tip`; badge span emptied + `hidden` (AD-8 no-flash); panel partial included after the drawer |
| `resources/views/layouts/ui-template.blade.php` | Dropped the `notifCount` forwarder arg (last server-side "3" echo) |
| `public/css/theme.css` | New tokens `--top-bar-height: 56px` (`.top-bar` refactored to consume it; visuals byte-identical, screenshot-verified) + `--color-scrim` light/dark pair (the one approved rgba); `.notif-*` family — desktop 360px fixed popover @ z 999 / ≤768px full-width top sheet @ z 998 overlay, 44px rows, 5 canonical container tiles |
| `public/js/ui-common.js` | Hoisted `openNavDrawer()`/`closeNavDrawer()` out of `initMobileNav` (behavior-identical, smoke-tested open/close/Esc/swipe/scroll-lock). Panel module: `NOTIF_ROLE_BY_PAGE` (/studentMyTimetable + upcomingReplacements → student, requestApproval → pl, else lecturer); per-role localStorage read state (AD-4, seed-once first paint from `read: true` flags, `MockData` never mutated); `relTime` + absolute `data-tip` times; `renderNotifList` (AD-5 unread-only + caught-up swap + AD-15 scroll restore); `markNotifRead`/`markAllNotifsRead`; `open/read/close/toggleNotifPanel` (aria-expanded, body overflow inline lock, AD-12 drawer↔panel mutual exclusion BOTH directions); `refreshNotifBadge` on DOMContentLoaded |
| `public/js/mock-data.js` | New §2.13 `MockData.notifications` — 12 rows (4/role: pl submitted/awaiting; lecturer approved/rejected; student update), `minutesAgo` ages, `read: true` on 6 seed-read rows; DELETED dead `studentTimetable.notificationCount` + stale comment (§2.5 single-source) |
| `ui-design-templates/request-approval-UI-design-template.blade.php` | `@extends` += `pageKey => 'requestApproval'` (role-map lever; routes untouched) |
| `ui-design-templates/student-my-timetable-UI-design-template.blade.php` + `upcoming-replacements-UI-design-template.blade.php` | Deleted per-page `'notifCount' => 3` args + inline `notifBadge.textContent` feed blocks (badge now computed by `refreshNotifBadge`) |

### Role → seed state
- Fresh localStorage = **badge 2 on every page** (2 unread rows per role; 6
  pre-read rows seeded at first paint).
- Behavior: row click = mark read + navigate (D4 deep links); list shows unread
  only (trims on read); 0 unread → "You're all caught up"; panel does **not**
  auto-clear on open.
- localStorage reset instructions: `localStorage.removeItem('notifications-read-student')`
  (also `-pl`, `-lecturer`) in DevTools → back to badge 2.

### Deviation notes (honest)
- Design's `.notif-head` border-bottom called for `--color-outline-variant` —
  token never existed in theme.css; used `--color-outline`.
- Data-tip on rows sits on the row anchor (whole-row hover) rather than only the
  time span; shown elements keep their `hidden` attribute with inline display
  overriding (cosmetic consistency note).
- Font sizes normalized to px per house convention (design's 0.75rem = 12px).

### Verification
T9–T14 all pass:
- [x] Fresh badges 2/2/2 on student / PL / lecturer pages
- [x] Row click trims + navigates; mark-all → caught-up
- [x] Persistence both ways + key-removal restore
- [x] 1280↔375: popover ↔ top-sheet
- [x] Drawer mutual exclusion both directions; overlay/Esc close
- [x] Scroll-glued fixed panel
- [x] Dark + light token render; console 0 errors
- [x] Hardcoded-color scan clean
- [x] Lint/types = pre-existing app/-only set

## [2026-10-02 post-apply] "Unread only" filter toggle (design §12, AD-19/AD-20)

User-requested permanent revision: the implicit unread-only tray gains an explicit filter switch.
**ON (default, every load)** = frozen AD-5 behavior byte-for-byte. **OFF** = all of the role's rows
render newest-first (`minutesAgo` asc), read rows muted via `.notif-row--read` (weight-400 title in
`--color-on-surface-variant`; still live deep-link anchors, mark-read idempotent). Caught-up message
only fires in ON mode; badge/pill/mark-all always follow the unread count. Toggle state not persisted.

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `partials/ui-notifications-panel.blade.php` | `.notif-filters` row with the shared `.toggle-wrapper` switch `#notifUnreadOnly` (checked default, label "Unread only") |
| `public/css/theme.css` | `.notif-filters` strip + `.notif-row--read` muted variant (tokens only) |
| `public/js/ui-common.js` | `renderNotifList` filter branch (unsorted frozen order ON / sorted copy OFF — MockData stays read-only), toggle `change` → re-render with AD-15 scroll restore, null-guarded |

Verified: 7 rows/4 muted in OFF mode, badge untouched by the toggle, muted-row click navigates
without storage change, mark-all in OFF mode mutes all + hides badge but keeps the list, ON-mode
caught-up intact, no horizontal overflow at 375px, console 0 errors.

## [2026-10-02 post-apply] Approved tile → success green (user correction)

`.notif-tile-approved` moved `--color-secondary-container` → `--color-success-container` (+ `-on-`),
matching every other live "Approved" surface (`.badge-normal`, approved summary value). The §10.0
canonical legend row "Approved → secondary-container" is the stale source — noted as backlog; the
design §5 table carries the correction inline.

## [2026-10-03 post-apply] Row hover tooltip = full message (AD-21)

Rows clip long titles/descs to one line in the 360px panel; hovering a row now shows the **full
text message** (`title — desc`) in the house tooltip, and the absolute datetime tooltip moved onto
the `.notif-row-time` span (design §3's original placement). Nested data-tips resolve via the
global `closest('[data-tip]')` mechanism — hover anywhere on the row = message, hover the time =
date/time. Rows also gained `aria-label` = full message.

**Post-verify fixes (from `.sdd/changes/notifications-panel` verification report, 2026-10-05):**

1. **D-1 (blocking) — AD-9 desktop list cap implemented:** `.notif-list` gains
   `max-height: 380px` on desktop (design.md D7's frozen number, over the proposal's "~420px")
   so rows stay reachable on a short viewport; the ≤768 mobile branch reverts it (`none`) —
   that mode scrolls the whole sheet per design.md:152. Verified live: with overflowing probe
   rows the list scrolls its full 504px range and the last row lands exactly on the panel's
   bottom edge; mobile recomputes panel cap `calc(100dvh - 56px)` with no inner cap.
2. **Suggestion 2 upgraded to fix — `.notif-close` styled:** it had no CSS at all and rendered
   the UA-default outset button in the panel header. Now mirrors the established
   `.modal-close` family (30×30, radius-sm, 1px outline border, on-surface-variant ✕, hover
   surface-variant / outline-strong) — same-name-same-color per §10.0.

### Postscript — sweep-fixes-round-1 (2026-10-06, F-2 pre-wire + F-12 closure)

1. **F-2 pre-wired to per-user mailbox semantics (user decision: backend-ready):** the badge
   now gives one number per logged-in user — `recipientId` derived onto every mock row
   (one-place map at the mock-data aliasing block, rows copied per the read-only convention;
   backend day = the API returns the user's own rows, drop the block); the per-role read
   store (`notifications-read-<role>`) is retired in favour of ONE user store
   (`notifications-read-user-<staffId>`), migrated at first paint by union (seed = the 10
   data `read:true` rows; legacy contribution verified equal), old keys removed.
   Badge/pill/mark-all follow the **mailbox unread total**; the panel LIST stays
   category-scoped by page context (AD-2 frozen, kept); mark-all = the whole user mailbox
   (backend semantics); panel open resyncs the header. AD-4/AD-8 comments updated.
   Verified live: badge 11 on lecturer AND student pages (drift gone), mark-one-read → 10
   with pill synced, reseed deterministic on fresh store, 0 console errors.
2. **F-12 (user decision: document as exception):** `CodingMAIN.md` §10.0 rule 1 now
   sanctions the layout's pre-theme paint literals (`html.dark/html.light` background in
   `ui-template.blade.php`) as the sole FOUC-guard exception, with an update-both note.
   Zero code change.
