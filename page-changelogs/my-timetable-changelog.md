# Changelog — Lecturer My Timetable

## [2026-10-09] Venue-restriction conflicts render on the timeline (SDD b005-diploma-conflict)

The shared timeline trait (`ResolvesTimetableTimeline`) now derives venue-restriction conflicts: a session in **B005 with any Diploma (`D*`) cohort** renders `status: 'conflict'` — loud striped red on the owner's My Timetable via the engine's default conflict path, quiet red for other viewers. The shared class modal shows "Scheduling conflict — needs attention" (no replace button — write path is Slice B). Derived at render time: no DB mutation, slot state machine (FR 4.11) untouched; covers My/Cohort/Student timetables. Precedence: pending request > conflict (a conflict block turns yellow while a replacement request on it is active). Verified: phpunit 129/129 (845 assertions), phpstan 0, lint clean.

## [2026-10-08] `?week=` deep link (undo lands on the cancelled class's week)

- The page now honours a `?week=N` query param: applied in the `DOMContentLoaded` init **after** `weekNav.load()`, so a deep link **wins over the saved week position** (localStorage `myTimetableWeek`); an absent/invalid/out-of-range param keeps the saved/mock-now behavior unchanged.
- Consumer: the shared cancel-undo toast — undo clicked **off** my-timetable navigates to `/my-timetable-ui?week=<matchKey.week>&restored=1` (ui-common.js, see oop-js-consolidation changelog 2026-10-08).
- Verified: `?week=5` with saved week 6 → select shows 5; plain load with saved week 6 → select shows 6; undo clicked on replacement-arrangement lands on `/my-timetable-ui?week=2&restored=1` with the cancelled block restored (`status: normal`) and the "Class restored." toast; undo clicked **on** my-timetable stays in place (no navigation). Full playwright suite 121 passed / 3 skipped.
## [2026-08-31] Wired to real data via Livewire (SDD wire-backend-into-refactored-ui, Slice A)

Page now served by `App\Livewire\MyTimetable` (full-page Livewire component) instead of the mock closure. Legacy template `MyTimetable-UI-design-template.blade.php` untouched on disk — served only when `APP_MOCK_FALLBACK=true` (config `app.mock_fallback`, design D10) or before the component existed (transitional rule).

### Mock → real mappings
| Mock | Real |
|---|---|
| `MockData.myTimetable.eventsByWeek` (seed week + repeat) | `ClassSession` where lecturer = viewer, per-week events built by `App\Concerns\ResolvesTimetableTimeline` (promoted shared builder, §10.0.6) |
| `MockData.semester` chip/dates | `Semesters` table (`Semester::active()`, design D9) |
| `MockData.holidays` | `holidays` table |
| `MockData.currentUser` | `auth()->user()` (+ staff_id) |

### Dropped / deferred (divergence duty)
- **Cancel Class button + confirm overlay removed from the detail modal** — `CancelClass` action ships in Slice B (tasks 2.5–2.6); mock fake-success toast deleted. Replace Now kept (navigates to the arrangement flow, wired in Slice B).
- Pending/approved overlays now derive from `replacement_requests` + `class_exceptions` (were hardcoded mock rows).
- Week navigation/keyboard/swipe/scroll-restore preserved 1:1 via the shared `ui-common.js` engine fed with server JSON (design Risk-2 mitigation; component root: single `<div class="lw-page">`).

## [2026-08-31] Sync upstream/fjing UI refactor (merge fd8c403)

Merged `upstream/fjing` (`FjingXR/class-replacement-system.git`, 267 commits `cfc1bb1..f44cc5c`) into `fedora-backend`. Policy: **theirs-first for UI** — upstream's refactored UI replaces the local copy; backend-only files (`app/Services`, `database/`) kept local. 13 conflicted UI files resolved with theirs. Verification: `migrate:fresh --seed` green (23 venues / 4 types), PHPStan 0 errors, PHPUnit 94/94, smoke 12/12 routes HTTP 200.

### Files Changed
- `resources/views/ui-design-templates/MyTimetable-UI-design-template.blade.php` — conflict → **theirs**
- Shared partials updated via merge: `ui-legend-bar`, `ui-summary-bar`, `ui-today-btn`, `ui-class-detail-modal`, `ui-empty-state`, `ui-grid-table`, `ui-guide-block`
- Shared assets: `theme.css`, `ui-common.js`, `mock-data.js`, `layouts/ui-template`, `partials/ui-nav-bar` — **theirs**

## [2026-08-16] Replaced hardcoded inline styles with shared utility classes

Refactored hardcoded `font-size`/`font-weight`/`color` inline styles to use shared CSS classes from `theme.css`. Specifically, the cancel-modal description text now uses `.section-heading-sub`.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/MyTimetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Line | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| 227 | `style="font-size:13px;opacity:0.7;margin-top:6px"` | `class="section-heading-sub" style="margin-top:6px"` |

## [2026-08-16] Venue dropdown redesigned as cascading 4-level columns

The venue dropdown is now a **cascading column picker** with a fixed 4-level hierarchy — **Type → Block → Floor → Room** — where each level occupies its own vertical column and a child column appears immediately to the right of its parent. Hovering (or clicking) a parent reveals the next column; only the **Room** is selectable.

```
 TYPE          BLOCK       FLOOR           ROOM
 Tutorial   ›  Block B  ›  Ground Floor  ›  B002 — 35 seats ...
 Lecture ...                            ›  Floor 1  ›  B100 — 35 seats ...
 Lab        ›  ...        ...
 CiscoLab   ›  ...
```

- Chevrons (`›`) appear only on items with a level beneath them; final Room rows show capacity + a checkmark/highlight when selected.
- **Favourites** and **Recent** are utility groups that are **not** hierarchy levels — they render at the top of the first column as **expandable 2-level groups** (`★ Favourites › [rooms]`, `Recent › [rooms]`), hidden when empty.
- Floor rule: 1st digit after the letter — `B0__` = Ground Floor, `B1__` = Floor 1, etc.
- The open menu grows horizontally to fit columns; no internal horizontal scrollbar.

### Files Changed

#### `public/js/ui-common.js`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `VenueDropdown._buildGroups()` | Rewritten | Creates the 4 `.venue-col` containers and resets active state (`activeType/activeBlock/activeFloor/activeUnit`). |
| `VenueDropdown._buildTypeColumn()` | Rewritten | Renders `★ Favourites` and `Recent` as expandable 2-level parent rows (hidden when empty), then `Types` list. |
| `VenueDropdown._buildBlockColumn()` | New | Hovering a Type builds the Block column (`Block A/B/C…`) for that type. |
| `VenueDropdown._buildFloorColumn()` | New | Hovering a Block builds the Floor column (Ground Floor / Floor N). |
| `VenueDropdown._buildRoomColumn()` | New | Hovering a Floor builds the Room column (final selectable rooms with capacity). |
| `VenueDropdown._buildUnitColumn()` | New | Hovering Favourites/Recent builds its room list in the second column (2-level only). |
| `VenueDropdown._createParentItem()` | New | Creates a `.venue-col-item-parent` row with label + chevron, tagged with `data-type`/`data-block`/`data-floor`/`data-unit`. |
| `VenueDropdown._createRoomItem()` | New | Creates a `.venue-col-item-room` row (star/clock icon for fav/recent, code, capacity, ✓ + `.selected` when active). |
| `VenueDropdown._updateActiveParents()` | Updated | Toggles `.active` on the current type/block/floor/unit parent row. |
| `VenueDropdown._open()` | Updated | Resets to just the Type column on every open. |
| `VenueDropdown._updateActive()` | Updated | Syncs `.selected` + ✓ checkmark across all room rows on select. |

#### `public/css/theme.css`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `.venue-dd-group*`, `.venue-dd-item*` | Removed | Old single-level flyout markup replaced by the cascading column model. |
| `.venue-col` | Added | Vertical column; hidden until `.visible`. |
| `.venue-col-header` | Added | Uppercase section label (Favourites / Recent / Types / Blocks / Floors / Rooms). |
| `.venue-col-item`, `.venue-col-item-parent` | Added | Row + chevron styling (`.active` highlights the current parent). |
| `.venue-col-item-room`, `.selected`, `.venue-col-item-check` | Added | Final room rows with capacity meta, selected highlight + ✓. |

## [2026-08-16] Today button now persists week selection

The "Today" button now saves the current week to `localStorage` (via `WeekNavigator.jumpToToday()` calling `this.save()`), consistent with arrow/dropdown navigation. Previously, clicking Today would jump the view but not persist — a page refresh would revert to the old week.

### Files Changed

#### `public/js/ui-common.js`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `WeekNavigator.jumpToToday()` | Updated | Now calls `this.save()` after updating the UI, matching the behavior of `prevWeek()`/`nextWeek()`/`selectWeek()`. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Replace Now passes original class duration to replacement-arrangement

The **Replace Now** button now includes `duration` (in hours, derived from the event's `start`/`end` slot indices via `(end - start + 1) / 2`) in the URL when navigating to `/replacement-arrangement`. The arrangement page then caps the selection at that many 30-min slots (duration × 2) so the replacement matches the original class length.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/MyTimetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `btnReplaceNow` | Updated | `goToReplacement(..., { day, start, end, venue, duration })` — duration = `(end - start + 1) / 2` hours. |

#### `public/js/ui-common.js`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `goToReplacement()` | Updated | Appends `duration` to the query string when `opts.duration` is a valid number. |

---

## [2026-08-15] Event hover tooltip shows cohort(s) instead of venue

The event-block tooltip previously showed `name · venue`, but the venue is already displayed on the block. It now shows the **cohort(s)** (`name · DFT2 (S1)`) — useful for a lecturer teaching across cohorts (the lecturer in the tooltip would just be the viewer). Implemented via a new `tooltipExtra(event)` option on the shared `buildTimetableGrid`; the CSS tooltip reads `attr(data-tip2)`.

### Files Changed

#### `public/js/ui-common.js`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `buildTimetableGrid()` | Updated | Sets `div.dataset.tip2` from optional `cfg.tooltipExtra(event)` (defaults to venue, so other callers are unaffected). |

#### `public/css/theme.css`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `.event-block::after` | Updated | Tooltip content `attr(data-name) ' · ' attr(data-venue)` → `attr(data-name) ' · ' attr(data-tip2)`. |

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/MyTimetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `buildTimetable()` | Updated | Passes `tooltipExtra` returning the event's `cohorts.join(' + ')` (or `cohort`/venue fallback). |

## [2026-08-15] Class detail modal: remove Lecturer row + add Status Description row

### Summary

- Removed the **Lecturer** row (this is the lecturer's own timetable — self-referential).
- Added a **Status Description** row: "Scheduled class with no issues" / "Replacement request awaiting approval" / "Scheduling conflict — needs attention".

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/MyTimetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `openModal()` | Updated | Dropped `Lecturer` row; added `Status Description` row (description now its own row, not inline caption). |

---

## [2026-08-15] Detail modal refinements: gray × close, general title, split rows, dot colours

### Summary

- **Close button** — normal gray `×` (was red dot); removed header `modal-status-badge`.
- **General title** — header now "Class Details" (course code → subtitle); status as badge row with a brief description.
- **Split rows** — Start/End Time split; status uses `.badge-*`.
- **Timeline dot colours vary by status** for pending requests (`dot-warning`).

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/MyTimetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `openModal()` | Updated | General title, split rows, badge status, dot colours. |

## [2026-08-15] Class detail modal redesign: unified detail sheet

### Summary

The Class Detail modal now uses the shared `DetailModal` "Detail Sheet": identity header (code title + name subtitle + status badge), optional pending global timeline, single flat group with definition rows (no per-row borders). Same fields preserved.

### Files Changed

#### `resources/views/ui-design-templates/MyTimetable-UI-design-template.blade.php`

| Location | Change | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `openModal()` | Rewritten | Uses `DetailModal.render` (field data unchanged). |

---

## [2026-08-15] Page-specific summary card descriptions

Added page-specific `description` text to each summary card (Total Classes / Teaching Hours / Replacements / Pending / Conflicts) instead of relying on the shared generic descriptions in `ui-summary-bar`. (`MyTimetable-UI-design-template.blade.php` summary bar.)

---

## [2026-08-13] Phase 3 UX Enhancement: Legend Tooltips

| 2026-07-21 08:09 | Lines 249–260 | Week arrow color | `color: on-secondary-container` → `on-surface-variant`; hover `rgba(12,51,33,0.1)` → `surface-variant` |

Cards now vertical (`.summary-value` above `.summary-label`), `background: surface`, `border: 1px solid outline`, `box-shadow: shadow-sm`. Total card: `border: 2px solid primary` + `background: primary-container`. Removed per-card background colors. |
| 2026-07-21 08:09 | Lines 948–964 | Summary bar HTML | Renamed `.num` → `.summary-value`, `.label` → `.summary-label`. Labels now single-line with CSS `text-transform: uppercase` instead of using `<br>` for line breaks. |
| 2026-07-21 08:09 | Lines 296–302 | Gap fix | Removed `flex: 1` from `.grid-wrapper` and `padding-bottom: 0` from `.grid-scroll` — legend bar now sits directly below the timetable without extra gap. |
| 2026-07-21 08:09 | Line 294 | Dark mode fix | Added `html.dark .week-select { color-scheme: dark }` — ensures native dropdown renders correctly in dark mode (matches request history fix). |

| 2026-08-01 14:26 | Lines 299–312 | New summary card | Added `Teaching Hours` summary card (2nd position, after Total Classes) — shows total teaching hours for the week, computed from event spans (`(end - start + 1) * 0.5` per slot), displayed as decimal when needed (e.g. 21.5). Card style: `1px dashed outline-strong` border + `surface-variant` background, value color `on-surface`. Matches CohortTimetable's `card-hours` pattern. |
| 2026-08-01 14:26 | Lines 588–590 | Summary bar 5 cards | Added `card-hours` entry to `@include('partials.ui-summary-bar')` — summary bar now has 5 cards (Total Classes, Teaching Hours, Confirmed Replacement, Pending Approval, Conflicts/Public Holiday).

| 2026-08-01 14:26 | Lines 936–952 | Summary logic | `updateSummary()` now computes `hours` and updates `sumHours` element — same formula as CohortTimetable. |
| 2026-08-01 14:56 | Lines 69–75, 543–555 | Semester chip | Removed `session-text` span (16px, centered in semester bar) and replaced with `semester-chip` pill in page header — same style (`secondary-container` bg, 20px radius, 12px/600) and position (after page title, before description) as cohort-timetable-ui. Text format changed to `202605 Semester · 15-Jun-2026 ~ 20-Sep-2026`. Semester bar now contains only week arrows + select (left-aligned). |
| 2026-08-01 15:01 | Line 7 | CSS dedup | Removed page-local `.semester-chip` CSS — now shared via `theme.css` (added there alongside `.page-header` section). |

| 2026-08-03 08:10 | Lines 241–273 | Holiday data | `weekData` now reads `MockData.holidays` to populate `holiday` and `holidayLabel` fields — enables off-day highlighting for non-Sunday public holidays. |

| 2026-08-03 08:10 | Lines 428–443 | Today + offday highlighting | `buildTimetable()` now adds `.today` class to current day column and `.offday` class to non-Sunday public holidays. Sunday shows "OFF" label without offday class (no dashed borders/opacity). |
| 2026-08-03 08:10 | Lines 460–463 | Offday slot class | Hour cells on Sunday or public holidays now use `.offday-slot` class (unified) instead of separate `.sunday-slot` / `.holiday-slot`. |

| 2026-08-03 08:20 | Lines 425–435 | Empty state logic | `buildTimetable()` now checks if events array is empty — hides table and shows `emptyState` div, otherwise shows table and hides empty state. |
| 2026-08-03 08:20 | Lines 367–373 | Status timeline | Added `status-timeline` HTML in `openModal()` for pending events — shows 3-step progress: "Submitted ✓ → Under Review → Awaiting Replacement". CSS already in `theme.css`. |

Selector uses `.timetable td.today-cell` to beat theme.css `:nth-child(2n)` specificity. Mobile override: `transparent` (today card header already stands out via solid primary bg). |
| 2026-08-03 | `@section('page-styles')` | Today badge CSS | Added `.today-badge` pill (inline in day-label, primary bg, 10px bold, uppercase) — visually marks today's row. |
| 2026-08-03 | `@section('page-styles')` | Mobile today card | Added `@media (max-width:768px)` override: `.timetable td.time-col.today` gets solid `var(--color-primary)` bg with `on-primary` text — distinguishable from other cards which use `primary-container`. |
| 2026-08-03 | `@section('page-scripts')` | today-cell class in buildTimetable() | Hour cells in today's row now get `today-cell` class (line 502). |
| 2026-08-03 | `@section('page-scripts')` | Today badge in buildTimetable() | Day label now includes `<span class="today-badge">Today</span>` when `day.today` is true. |
| 2026-08-03 | `@section('page-scripts')` | todayMs uses real-time | Changed `new Date('2026-09-18')` to `new Date()` — today column now highlights the actual current day instead of hardcoded date. |
| 2026-08-03 | `@section('page-scripts')` | currentWeekIndex uses real-time | Changed `new Date('2026-09-18')` to `new Date()` — default week selection uses actual current date. |
| 2026-08-04 | — | Refactored: replaced inline page-header/week-nav/empty-state/grid-table/modal with `@include('partials.…')` (OOP Phase 1) | Page uses `ui-page-header`, `ui-week-nav`, `ui-grid-table`, `ui-empty-state`, `ui-class-detail-modal` partials. |
| 2026-08-13 | `@section('page-styles')` | macOS-style update (Phase 4) | `cancel-overlay`: `rgba(0,0,0,0.55)` → `0.45`, `blur(4px)` → `blur(8px)` to match theme.css modal. All 4 button classes (`btn-replace-now`, `btn-cancel-class`, `btn-cancel-secondary`, `btn-cancel-danger`): `font-weight: 600` → `500` for macOS consistency. Added `:focus-visible` outline rings to all 4 buttons. |
| 2026-08-13 | `@section('page-styles')` | macOS modal refinement | `cancel-overlay` blur synced from `8px` → `6px` to match refined theme.css modal overlay. |
| 2026-08-13 | `public/css/theme.css` (shared) | macOS table fix | `.timetable`: `border-collapse:collapse` → `separate` + `border-spacing:4px`; removed 1px cell borders; hover uses `var(--color-surface-variant)`; removed zebra striping. `.badge` border-radius 6px→8px. |
| 2026-08-14 | `@section('page-styles')` | Offday-slot today-cell fix | Added `.today-cell.offday-slot { background: transparent; }` override so PH/Sunday empty cells are not red when today. |
| 2026-08-14 | `prevWeek/nextWeek/selectWeek` | WeekNavigator delegation | Local nav logic replaced with `weekNav.prevWeek()/nextWeek()/selectWeek()`; `buildTimetable()` syncs `currentWeek = weekNav.currentWeek`. Removed manual select-index/subtitle/progress/arrow/save updates. |

## [2026-10-03] Disabled print icon on the week-nav toolbar

Shared `ui-week-nav` gained an opt-in `'showPrint' => true` arg rendering a printer icon-button
(inline SVG, `.print-btn` in theme.css), right-aligned at the toolbar edge via `margin-left: auto`.
Enabled stub: click fires the shared `toast.show('Printing is coming soon')` bottom-left toast bar;
`title="Coming soon"` native tooltip on hover. No JS beyond the one-liner onclick.

### Postscript — sweep-fixes-round-1 (2026-10-06, F-11)

**Week persistence key namespaced.** WeekNavigator's generic `currentWeek` default was a
cross-page overwrite hazard (my-timetable / cohort / student all defaulted to it). Now:
each page passes an explicit key — this page saves to `myTimetableWeek`, cohort-timetable
to `cohortTimetableWeek`, student-my-timetable to `studentTimetableWeek`; any keyless
WeekNavigator derives `weekNav-<selectId>`. One-time migration in `load()` adopts a legacy
`currentWeek` value on first visit then retires the old key (verified live: legacy value
inherited, old key gone; default week math unchanged).

### Postscript — holiday-badge-generic-label (2026-10-07, shared ui-common)

Day-header holiday badges now read generically as **PUBLIC HOLIDAY** (markup
text `Public Holiday`; the badge CSS already uppercases it), with the specific
holiday name — e.g. `Deepavali Holiday (In Lieu)`, `Christmas Eve` — shown on
hover via the shared `data-tip` tooltip system. Label-less holiday flags show
no tooltip. One-line change in `HtmlBuilder.dayHeader` (ui-common.js:2155);
applies to every timetable page via the shared builder.

## [2026-10-07] Class modal grouped into tabs (shared DetailModal taxonomy)

The Class Details modal now groups rows into three tabs — Class Information /
Schedule / Status — via the shared `renderModalGroups` helper in
`ui-common.js` (see oop-js-consolidation postscript). No blade changes on this
page; behavior comes from `openClassModal`'s auto-grouping.

---

## [2026-10-07] Confirmed replacement modal shows the replaced original class

Clicking a blue replacement block now shows a fourth tab **Original Class** —
Original Date (weekday + dd-Mon-yyyy), Original Time, Original Venue and
Original Conflict reason — built from the seeded `replacedFor`/`replacedReason`
fields. The original week's same slot is now flagged red 'conflict' with that
same reason, so the grid tells the full conflict → replacement story
(e.g. AMCS2093 P DFT2: Fri 13-Nov B011 conflict → Fri 27-Nov replacement).

---

## [2026-10-07] Conflict blocks now render red (was: unstyled grey)

Shared-default classifier fix in `buildTimetableGrid` (ui-common.js) — conflict
events get `.event-conflict` (red) instead of no status class.

## [2026-10-07] Demo conflict reasons made venue-coherent (follow-up)

A dataset audit showed NO overlapping blocks anywhere — reasons implying a
visible counterpart ("Clash with another module", "Venue double-booked")
can't be backed up on the grid. The seeded demo reasons are now venue-aware:
labs (B005/B006/B009-B011) → "Lab equipment failure", other venues →
"Lecturer on leave". Both halves of each conflict→replacement pair carry the
same reason; the raw cycle and overrides live in
`seed_mock_data.py` (CONFLICT_REMARKS / default_reason / reason override).

## [2026-10-08] Real timetable records (semester 202505 datasets) replace hand-made seeds

Backend data change — no markup/CSS changes to this page (SDD
`import-real-schedule-records`).

- The 35 hand-made demo sessions are GONE; My Timetable now renders the **101
  real class sessions** extracted from the aSc PDFs (validated datasets:
  101 blocks / 147 h, cross-checked 3-way lecturer↔venue↔cohort, 46/46
  re-checks) — 5425 now sees her own real week (10 blocks), not fixtures.
- Sessions are status-neutral: normal/pending/replacement states come from the
  app's own request tables (currently empty until Slice B/C re-demos).
- Holiday styling anchors moved to the canonical demo calendar
  (semester 2026-09-21 → 2026-12-27): **W8 Mon** (Deepavali in lieu), **W14
  Thu** (Christmas Eve), **W14 Fri** (Christmas Day) — replacing the 5 old
  placeholder rows (W1/W3/W5/W7).
- Invariants re-pinned and green: 101/155/3963 (occupied incl. holiday rule),
  0 orphans, 0 venue double-bookings; full suite 115/115.
### Postscript — cancel-class-enhancement (2026-10-08, SDD change `cancel-class-enhancement`)

Lecturers can now cancel their own classes — status normal with an end time
in the future (real clock) — directly from the my-timetable class modal via
the shared CancelClassModal (`partials/ui-cancel-class-modal`) with a
mandatory enum reason (6 values incl. Other + detail; OOP: `ClassCancellation`
in `ui-common.js`). A cancelled block vanishes and its slot frees; the
sessionStorage ledger (`classCancellationLedger`) replays the state across
pages, with an undo toast (12 s) on any landing page until undone/arranged.

### Postscript — stale View-Full-Request + toast snooze (2026-10-08, SDD-waived micro-fix)

Two shared-modal fixes: (1) the "View Full Request" anchor appended for a
pending class lingered in the static footer when a normal class was opened
next — footer cleanup now runs on EVERY `openClassModal` open
(`ui-common.js`). (2) The cancellation undo toast no longer nags after the
user ✕-closes it: the ✕ snoozes that entry's toast for the session
(`toastSnoozed`; undo remains available on the replacement-home chip).

### Postscript — replacement-status classes now cancellable (2026-10-08, SDD-waived extension)

FR 2.16 read literally: a confirmed replacement slot is still the lecturer's
own scheduled class, so `isCancellable` now accepts status `'replacement'`
alongside `'normal'` (own + future-end + non-holiday guards unchanged).
Undo semantics hardened to match: the ledger entry records `priorStatus` at
cancel time and `undo()` restores THAT — a cancelled replacement block comes
back as a replacement (Original-Date trail intact) instead of being demoted
to 'normal'. The approved request itself is untouched (audit trail). The
cancelled class then joins the replacement-home requires-replacement list
like any other cancellation. Covered by new spec test S17 (14 passing).

## [2026-10-08] Conflict count on summary card + Replace Now on holiday/conflict + guide fix

Three fixes from the 2026-10-07/08 bug audit:

- **Conflicts card was always 0.** `computeSummary` counted only
  holiday-overlapping classes; explicit `status === 'conflict'` events were
  never counted. Now one branch counts both (`conflict || holiday`, guarded
  against double-counting). Week 0 live: card reads 2, matching the 2 red
  blocks.
- **Replace Now now shows for conflicts too.** The footer button gated on
  `day.holiday` alone, so a conflicted class (the most common reason to
  replace) hid it. Gate is now `day.holiday || event.status === 'conflict'`.
  Verified live: conflict footer `disp:flex`, pending `disp:none`.
- **How-to guide drift**: status list dropped Approved/Rejected (not grid
  statuses); "click a normal/approved slot" → "click any slot".
- Dead code removed: unused `loadSavedWeek()`/`saveWeek()` wrappers (week
  persistence runs through `WeekNavigator` directly).

### Postscript — snooze rule extended (2026-10-08, U3 decision)

The undo toast now shows for **5 s** (was 12 s) and **auto-dismissing after the
full display also snoozes** it — surviving the whole toast counts as "seen",
same as clicking ✕. Only navigating away mid-display (timer killed) leaves the
entry unsnoozed, so the toast legitimately re-shows on the next load.
`ToastManager.show` gained an `onAutoDismiss` hook alongside `onManualDismiss`;
`UNDO_TOAST_MS` 12000 → 5000. Live-verified all three paths, 0 console errors.

### Postscript — undo feedback + grid rebuild (2026-10-08, U1/U2)

Clicking the undo toast's **Undo** now works as it looks: `ToastManager`
dismisses the undo bar **before** running the callback (U1 — the callback's
"Class restored." toast was previously wiped ~0 ms after appearing), and the
callback rebuilds whichever grid is on screen after `ClassCancellation.undo()`
(U2 — every timetable page's `buildTimetable()` / replacement-home's
`buildTable()`; the class reappears without a manual reload). Confirmation
toast shows last, over the rebuilt grid. Live-verified on my-timetable,
student page, and replacement-home; 0 console errors.

### Postscript — conflict blocks made unmistakable (2026-10-08)

`.event-conflict` (global, theme.css) upgraded from a plain red tint to
a **2px solid `--color-error` border + diagonal caution stripes**
(`repeating-linear-gradient` over the container tint, token-only via
`color-mix` — adapts to dark theme). Same meaning, same red per §10.0;
just impossible to mistake for an ordinary block at grid glance.
Applies to every page rendering conflicted classes (cohort, venue,
my timetable, student). No legend or test changes needed; verified live
on cohort (dft2s1 W4 AMCS2093) and venue (B110 W4), suite 124 passed.

### Postscript — conflict & PH unified to one loud red (2026-10-09)

On personal timetables everything shown is the viewer's own, so the old
split (conflicted = loud striped `event-conflict`, public-holiday = quiet
plain tint) was meaningless noise. Default builder (`ui-common.js`) now
sends **both** conflict-status and PH-day classes to the loud
`event-conflict` treatment — one red, one meaning: "this class will not
run as scheduled". The shared legend's default conflict swatch reuses the
real `event-conflict` class so the legend shows the exact styling
(Cohort/Venue pages keep their own owner-gated legend split: loud = yours,
quiet tint = others'). Verified: my timetable W8 Monday (Deepavali
in-lieu) + W14 (Christmas) PH classes and student page W1/W5 conflicts +
W8 PH all render loud; suite green.

### Postscript — diagonal hatching removed; loud red = 3px border only (2026-10-09)

The 45° caution stripes on `.event-conflict` proved too busy — reverted to
a plain `--color-error-container` tint, with the border thickened
2px → **3px** so own/personal conflicted + public-holiday classes still
read unmistakably (owner-gating unchanged: loud border = yours, quiet
plain tint = others' on cohort/venue; personal pages all loud). Legend
swatches follow automatically. Verified live on all four pages.

### Postscript — block tooltips show cohort + lecturer + status (2026-10-09)

- Event-block hover tooltips now read
  `"Subject · Cohort(s) · Lecturer · Status"`
  (e.g. `Operating Systems · DFT2(S1) + DSF2(S1) · En. Lim Jia Zheng ·
  Normal`). Cohort context is kept as the page's `tooltipExtra`; the shared
  builder appends lecturer + run-status (`eventStatusLabel()`) — uniform
  with the other timetable pages.

### Postscript — §10.0 two-axis block language (2026-10-09)

- **Every block now carries the loud 3px border** — everything on this page
  is the viewer's own, so ownership borders don't apply here (the 3px vs
  0.5px hairline split only matters on the cohort/venue browse pages).
- Status colours stay: Normal = success green, Pending = tertiary,
  Replacement = **primary blue (kept on personal pages only)**,
  Conflict/Holiday = error red with its 3px border.
- Legend unchanged at 4 chips (Normal / Replacement / Pending /
  Conflict / Public Holiday); swatches now reuse the real block classes so they show
  the exact fill + border styling.

### Postscript — card flip-back keywords (2026-10-09, SDD: warning-modal-keywords)

The five summary-card flip-backs use the new keyword language — **YOUR WEEKLY TIMETABLE**,
**TEACHING HOURS**, **REPLACEMENT LECTURER** in the default color; **WAITING FOR APPROVAL**
and **SCHEDULING CLASHES** in red (attention cards: pending + conflict).
