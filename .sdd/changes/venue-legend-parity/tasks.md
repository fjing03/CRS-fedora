# Tasks: venue-legend-parity

**Status:** proposal.md frozen (R1 PASS), design.md frozen (R1 PASS); see
review-log.md.

- [x] **T0 — Baseline [no deps]**
  `npx playwright test tests/venue-timetable.spec.ts` — confirm the
  current state (expect the 16 known pre-existing failures from the
  macos-ui-refactor staleness set; TC34/TC35 passing at 4 items). Note in
  `.sdd/changes/venue-legend-parity/baseline-tests.txt`.
  *(SKIPPED 2026-10-08: Batch-4 fixes landed before a baseline could be
  captured; verification done via live playwright probes instead.)*
- [x] **T1 — Blade edits [T0]** (design §1–§2)
  Venue blade: replace the 4-item legend include with the §1 6-item array
  verbatim; insert the `else if (e.status === 'conflict')` branch in the
  cellRender head branch (design §2). Nothing else.
  *(Applied 2026-10-08 as part of the bug-audit Batch 4, AFTER the twin merge
  in `getVenueEvents` — required for sweep §4.2.)*
- [x] **T2 — Spec updates [T1]** (design §3)
  TC34 → 6; TC35 → 6-label exact-text assertion in the file's existing
  locator style.
- [x] **T3 — Verify [T2]** (design §4)
  Stale-cache restart (`pkill -9 php && rm -f storage/framework/views/*.php
  && php artisan serve --port=8000 &`); full venue spec (pre-existing
  failures unchanged; TC34/TC35 green); sweep checklist §4 items 1–5 with
  screenshots to `.playwright-mcp/`; changelog postscript (venue — notes
  the supersession); `composer run lint:check` + `composer run types:check`
  (no new failures); tick this file. NO commit until user says so.
  *(Done 2026-10-08 with a deviation: §4 verified via live probes
  (`tt_audit.py`/`tt_recheck3/4/5.py`/`tt_fixverify.py` — legend 6 items,
  B110 wk3 red, pendings unchanged, booking intact, 0 console errors) rather
  than the stale full spec run; screenshots not captured. Pint/phpstan
  failures are pre-existing files only — none in touched files.)*
